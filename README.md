# zoraxy-datashield-blocklist

A [Zoraxy](https://zoraxy.aroz.org/) plugin that blocks incoming connections from IPs listed in the [Data-Shield Critical IPv4 Blocklist](https://github.com/duggytuxy/Data-Shield_IPv4_Blocklist) — roughly 100,000 known-malicious IPv4 addresses, refreshed automatically every 6 hours.

## Features

- Blocks ~100k threat IPs from the Data-Shield Critical list with sub-millisecond overhead per request
- Auto-refreshes the blocklist every 6 hours (no restart needed)
- Manual blocklist: add or remove individual IPs from the Zoraxy plugin UI
- Private/loopback/link-local addresses are never blocked regardless of the list
- IPv6 traffic passes through unaffected (the Data-Shield list is IPv4-only)
- Displays live stats: IPs loaded, last update time, total blocked requests

## Requirements

- [Zoraxy](https://zoraxy.aroz.org/) with plugin support enabled
- Go 1.24+ (to build from source)

## Installation

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kianby/zoraxy-datashield-blocklist.git
cd zoraxy-datashield-blocklist
go build -o datashield-blocklist .
```

Then copy the binary into Zoraxy's plugin directory:

```bash
cp datashield-blocklist /path/to/zoraxy/plugins/datashield-blocklist/
```

Restart Zoraxy — the plugin will appear in the Plugins section of the admin UI.

### Pre-built binary

Download the latest release binary for your platform and place it in Zoraxy's `plugins/datashield-blocklist/` directory, then restart Zoraxy.

## Usage

Once installed and enabled in Zoraxy, the plugin works automatically. You can view its status and manage manual overrides through the plugin's UI in the Zoraxy admin panel.

### Manual IP management

In the plugin UI you can:
- **Add an IP** to immediately block a specific IPv4 address (takes effect instantly, no restart needed)
- **Remove an IP** to unblock a manually-added address
- **Force refresh** to re-download the Data-Shield blocklist on demand

> **Note:** Manually added IPs are held in memory only. They are cleared when the plugin or Zoraxy restarts.

### What gets blocked

When a blocked IP connects, Zoraxy routes the request through this plugin's capture handler, which returns a `403 Forbidden` response. The connection is dropped before it reaches any proxied backend.

### What is never blocked

- IPv6 addresses (the Data-Shield list covers IPv4 only)
- Private ranges: `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`
- Loopback: `127.0.0.0/8`
- Link-local: `169.254.0.0/16`
- Carrier-grade NAT: `100.64.0.0/10`

## Blocklist source

This plugin uses the **critical** tier of the [Data-Shield IPv4 Blocklist](https://github.com/duggytuxy/Data-Shield_IPv4_Blocklist) maintained by [@duggytuxy](https://github.com/duggytuxy). The list targets scanners, botnets, and other high-confidence threat sources.
